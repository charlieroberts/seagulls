# Seagulls.js demos

This directory contains "complete" simulation examples; see the [howtos]('./howtos') directory for smaller examples of specific techniques.

1. [*Conway's Game of Life*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/1_game_of_life) - A classic artificial life simulation, GPU accelerated.
2. [*Reaction Diffusion*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/2_reaction_diffusion) - Turing's morphogenesis algorithm.
3. [*Langton's Vants (basic)*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/3_vants_basic) - Langton's virtual ants simulation with a single rule. 
4. [*Langton's Vants (advanced)*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/4_vants_advanced) - Langton's virtual ants simulation, with two rules and decaying pheromones. 
5. [*Boids (basic)*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/5_boids_basic) - The Craig Reynolds flocking simulation. 
6. [*Boids (advanced)*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/6_boids_advanced) - Flocking simulation with instances rendered to a texture so that feedback can be applied. The mouse position also repels agents. 
7. [*Slime Mold*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/7_physarum) - Physarum/slime mold simulation. 
8. [*Slime Mold w/ video*](https://charlieroberts.github.io/seagulls/demos/8_physarum_video) - Physarum consuming live video (Chrome only)
